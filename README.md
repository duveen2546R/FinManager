## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (latest stable version)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.10 or higher)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
*   **For iOS/Siri:** A Mac with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository and `cd` into it.**

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   Connect to your local or cloud (e.g., AWS RDS) PostgreSQL instance.
    *   Create a new database and run the `schema.sql` script to create the `users` and `transactions` tables.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables (Crucial):**
    *   You need a permanent API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). It is **highly recommended to enable billing** on the associated Google Cloud project to get a non-expiring key and higher usage limits.
    *   In your project's root directory, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Copy the contents of `.env.example` into this new file.
    *   Open `.env` and fill in all your secret credentials (Google API key and all database details).
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Ensure the `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` file to keep your secrets from being committed.

6.  **Run the Flask Server:**
    *   This command automatically loads your `.env` file and makes the server accessible on your local network.
        ```bash
        flask run --host=0.0.0.0
        ```
    *   The backend should now be running on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`.

### üì± Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Flutter project folder.**

2.  **Get Flutter dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Configure the API URL (Most Important Step):**
    *   You **must** replace the placeholder IP address in your Dart files with your computer's local network IP address (or your deployed server's address).
    *   Find your IP on macOS/Linux with `ifconfig` or `ip addr`, and on Windows with `ipconfig`.
    *   Open all files in `lib/Screens/` that make API calls and update the `apiUrl` constant.
    *   **Example:**
        ```dart
        // Change from: 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/...' 
        // To (using your actual IP): 'http://192.168.1.10:5000/...'
        ```
4. **Configure Native Permissions:**
    *   **iOS:** Add `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to `ios/Runner/Info.plist` for voice features.
    *   **Android:** Add `RECORD_AUDIO` permission and a `<queries>` tag to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` for voice features.

6.  **Run the Flutter App:**
    *   Select your target device and run the app.
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```

## üìñ API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Endpoint                 | Method | Description                                    |
| :----------------------- | :----: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `/register`              | `POST` | Registers a new user.                          |
| `/login`                 | `POST` | Authenticates a user and returns their details. |
| `/transaction`           | `POST` | Adds a new income or expense transaction.      |
| `/transactions/<user_id>`| `GET`  | Fetches all transactions for a specific user.  |
| `/ai/agent/invoke`       | `POST` | Sends a natural language query to the AI agent. |
